# 👋 Welcome

Hey, I’m Eugene Boondock.
I build, I experiment, I think a lot about AI—and sometimes I get lost in virtual worlds like Earth2. This space is where I share the things I'm working on, learning, or just exploring out of curiosity.

### 🧠 About Me

I'm a web developer and AI enthusiast with a background in Politics & International Relations. I taught myself to code through projects, persistence, and a genuine love for trying to figure things out. I like clean logic, efficient code, and anything that sits at the intersection of humans and machines. 

I have built numerous websites like [**Earthie**](https://earthie.world) - A dynamic Community Wiki platform for the Earth2 Community (with over 17 APIs being used)
And also: [**3rdIslandTours**](https://3rdislandtours.com/) - Website for a tour company

Languages and tools I’ve worked with:
`HTML` • `CSS` • `JavaScript`: `[React, Nextjs, Nodejs]` • `Python` • `SQL` •

I'm always learning, always building—whether it's a tool, a new idea, or a philosophy I can code into something useful. If you're curious about AI, coding, virtual economies, or just want to think aloud about the future, you're in good company here.
